## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker and docker-compose installed
- At least one AI API key: [Gemini](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey), [ChatGPT](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys), [Claude](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys), or [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/settings/api)

### Installation

1. **Extract the project files**

2. **Create environment file:**
```bash
   cp .env.example .env
```

3. **Edit `.env` and add one or more AI provider API keys:**
```env
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
   PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your_perplexity_api_key
   PORT=3030
   # Optional: For cross-origin requests, set ALLOWED_ORIGINS
   # ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://example.com,https://another-domain.com
```

4. **Start the application:**
```bash
   docker-compose up -d
```

5. **Open your browser:**
http://localhost:3030


## How to Play

1. **Setup:** Select language, choose a topic (or get AI-generated random topics), configure players (2-5), questions (5-50), and answer options (4-8)
2. **Gameplay:** Players take turns answering questions via drag-and-drop or click, with real-time feedback and scoring
3. **Winning:** Highest score wins, with support for ties. Restart anytime with preserved settings

For detailed gameplay instructions, see the **[User Guide](docs/usage.md)**.

## Security Analysis with GitHub CodeQL

This repository includes GitHub CodeQL for automated security and code quality analysis. CodeQL runs automatically on pushes, pull requests, and on a weekly schedule.

### Enabling CodeQL

If you encounter an error stating that actions must be from repositories owned by your organization, you need to update your GitHub repository settings:

1. **Navigate to repository settings:**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click on **Settings** → **Actions** → **General**

2. **Update Actions permissions:**
   - Under **Actions permissions**, select **"Allow all actions and reusable workflows"**
   - Click **Save**

### Alternative: Fork Actions (If Keeping Restrictions)

If you prefer to keep restrictions on external actions, you can fork the required action repositories into your organization:

1. **Fork these repositories:**
   - [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout)
   - [`github/codeql-action`](https://github.com/github/codeql-action)
   - [`actions/setup-node`](https://github.com/actions/setup-node)

2. **Update workflow file:**
   - Edit `.github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml`
   - Replace `actions/checkout@v4` with `your-org/checkout@v4`
   - Replace `github/codeql-action/init@v3` with `your-org/codeql-action/init@v3`
   - Replace `actions/setup-node@v4` with `your-org/setup-node@v4`
   - Replace `github/codeql-action/analyze@v3` with `your-org/codeql-action/analyze@v3`

After enabling CodeQL, you'll see security analysis results in:
- The **Security** tab of your repository
- Pull request checks
- Automated weekly reports

## Security Features

VCVQ implements comprehensive security measures:

- **Security Headers:** Helmet middleware provides security headers including CSP, X-Frame-Options, and more
- **CORS Protection:** Configurable CORS with secure defaults (allows localhost, requires ALLOWED_ORIGINS for cross-origin)
- **Rate Limiting:** API endpoints are rate-limited to prevent abuse
- **Input Validation:** Server-side validation using express-validator
- **XSS Protection:** HTML escaping for all user-controlled and AI-generated content
- **Prompt Injection Prevention:** Sanitization of user inputs in AI prompts
- **JSON Parsing Error Handling:** Prevents server crashes from malformed responses
- **Docker Security:** Non-root user, security options, resource limits
- **Fuzzing:** Property-based testing with fast-check to detect vulnerabilities through automated testing with random and malicious inputs

For detailed security information, see **[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)** and the **[Testing Guide](docs/testing.md)**.

## Development Assistance

VCVQ includes AI-powered development assistance through the `prompts/` directory. See the **[Development Guide](docs/development.md)** for details on using the `/vibe` command and project-specific prompts.

- **AI:** Google Gemini (with model fallback), ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity
- **Frontend:** Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
- **Features:** HTML5 Drag and Drop API, Internationalization (i18n)
- **Security:** Helmet (security headers), CORS, express-rate-limit, express-validator

- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint

All endpoints include rate limiting, input validation, and security headers. See the **[API Reference](docs/interface-reference.md)** for complete documentation.

## Testing

VCVQ includes comprehensive testing with property-based fuzzing for security:

```bash
npm test                    # Run all tests
npm run test:fuzz           # Run fuzz tests only
npm run test:fuzz:verbose   # Verbose output
```

For detailed testing information, see the **[Testing Guide](docs/testing.md)**.

## Environment Variables

- At least one of `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, or `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` is required
- `PORT` (optional) - Server port, defaults to 3030
- `NODE_ENV` (optional) - Environment mode (development/production), defaults to production in Docker
