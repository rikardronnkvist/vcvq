Real-time, turn-based multiplayer quiz built for the car. Generate 10 multiple-choice questions with 6 options from any topic using Google Gemini Free Tier. Play with 2â€“4 players on phones or tablets â€” no installs required.

**Project Home:** https://github.com/rikardronnkvist/vcvq

## Features
- 2â€“4 players, turn-based
- AI-generated questions via Google Gemini
- 10 questions per game, each with 6 options (1 correct)

- HTML5 drag-and-drop answer selection
- Real-time sync across devices using Socket.IO
- Color-coded players (1â€“4 â†’ blue, red, green, purple)
- Clear turn indicator and immediate answer feedback (green/red)
- Live score and winner declaration
- 2-second review pause between questions
- Restart keeps player count and names
- Responsive layout for tablets/phones (car-friendly UI)

## Architecture
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express + Socket.IO
- **Frontend:** Vanilla JS + HTML5 Drag & Drop API
- **AI:** Google Gemini (1.5 Flash) via REST API
- **Container:** Docker + docker-compose
- **Port:** 3030

## Quick Start (Docker)
1. Clone and prepare env:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rikardronnkvist/vcvq.git
   cd vcvq
   cp .env.sample .env
   # Edit .env to set GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY and PORT if needed
   ```
2. Build and run:
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build -d
   ```
3. Open the app:
   - http://localhost:3030

> Tip: If you're hosting on a phone hotspot in the car, ensure other players connect to the same network and open the host machine's IP with port 3030.

## Development (Local Node)
```bash
npm install
npm start
# Open http://localhost:3030
```

## Environment Variables
The app reads settings from `.env` (never commit your real keys):

- `GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY` â€” Your Google Generative Language API key
- `PORT` â€” Web server port (defaults to 3030)

See `.env.sample` for an example.

## How To Play
1. **Create Game** on the landing page
   - Choose topic, language, and player count (2â€“4)
   - Set player names or use defaults:
     1. Driver
     2. Front Passenger
     3. Left Back Passenger
     4. Right Back Passenger
2. Share the **room link** with players (it includes `?room=CODE` and `&player=N`)
3. The current player drags their **colored number token** onto one of the six answer boxes.
4. Feedback shows: **green = correct**, **red = incorrect** (and highlights correct answer)
5. After a 2-second pause, the turn moves to the next player and the next question.
6. After 10 questions, the winner(s) are announced. Use **Restart** to play again â€” players and names are preserved.

## Self-Hosting Notes
- The server stores game state **in memory**; a single container is sufficient for small groups.
- To play across devices, share the room code or link. NAT/firewall rules may be required for remote access.
- **Privacy:** Questions are generated by Google Gemini. No persistent storage of questions or scores on the server.
